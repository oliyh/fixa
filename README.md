Better fixtures for Clojure/script

Why does `clojure.test` limit us to `:each` and `:once` fixtures for the entire namespace?
Shouldn't the granularity of an individual test be where we can apply fixtures?

## Usage

### Annotate your tests

Add `:fixa/fixture` (singular) or `:fixa/fixtures` (a list) as metadata to your `deftest`:

```clj
(deftest ^{:fixa/fixture fixture-a} single-fixture-test
  (is (= 1 1)))

(deftest ^{:fixa/fixtures [fixture-a fixture-b]} multiple-fixtures-test
  (is (= 1 1)))
```

### Kaocha

All that's needed is the `fixa.kaocha/wrap-run` plugin. Add it to your `tests.edn` like this:

```clj
#kaocha/v1 {:plugins [:hooks]
            :kaocha.hooks/wrap-run [fixa.kaocha/wrap-run]}
```

### clojure.test

Unfortunately due to the way clojure.test is written, an alternative `deftest` is required to smuggle the fixtures through.

```clj
(require '[fixa.clj-test :refer [deftest]])

(deftest ^{:fixa/fixture fixture-a} single-fixture-test
  (is (= 1 1)))
```
